# NFT Marketplace

This NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, specifically designed for the trading and auctioning of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Utilizing the Sepolia Ethereum test network and developed with Hardhat, this project demonstrates a seamless integration of OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 (and ERC-1155, if applicable) contracts for secure and standardized NFT operations.

## Features

- **Create and Mint NFTs**: Users can mint their own NFTs by uploading digital assets.
- **List NFTs for Sale**: Sellers can list their NFTs on the marketplace, setting prices and auction terms.
- **Buy and Sell NFTs**: Facilitates secure buying and selling of NFTs through smart contracts.
- **Wallet Integration**: Supports popular Ethereum wallets for transactions and NFT management.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum Blockchain**: For decentralized, secure transactions.
- **Sepolia Test Network**: For testing smart contract interactions.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for deployment, testing, and debugging.
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: For secure, standard-compliant smart contracts (ERC-721, ERC-1155).
- **Ethers.js**: Ethereum wallet implementation and interaction with the blockchain.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- NPM (v7.x or later)
- An Ethereum wallet with Sepolia testnet ETH

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nihar0071/NFT-MarketPlace.git
   cd NFT-MarketPlace
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your wallet private key and Sepolia network URL:

   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here
   SEPOLIA_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/your_project_id_here
   ```

4. **Compile Smart Contracts**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. **Deploy Smart Contracts to Sepolia**

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run --network sepolia scripts/deploy.js
   ```

### Running Tests

To run tests, execute:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Interacting with the Marketplace

- **Minting NFTs**: Use the `createToken` function in the deployed smart contract.
- **Listing NFTs for Sale**: After minting, list your NFTs using the marketplace's listing function.
- **Buying NFTs**: Interact with the marketplace smart contract to purchase NFTs.
